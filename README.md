This repository contains my code written for the course [ME 433](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/courses/descriptions/433-advanced-mechatronics.html) at Northwestern University. 
Most projects use the [PIC32MX250F128B](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/60001168H.pdf) microcontroller. 

###HW 1:
Building a PIC32 circuit with voltage regulator + Hello World. 

###HW 2 & 3: 
Design a PCB of the PIC32 circuit in EAGLE. 

###HW 4:
Using SPI to communicate with a [MCP4902 DAC](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP4902). 
 
Using I2C to communicate with a [MCP23008](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP23008) I/O pin expander.

###HW 5:
Writing Hello World to LCD. [128 x 128 pixel TFT LCD](http://www.gearbest.com/lcd-led-display-module/pp_219125.html)

###HW 6: 
Read the [LSM6DS33](https://www.pololu.com/product/2736) IMU and write values to LCD. 

###HW 7:
[MPLAB Harmony](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-harmony) project with USB; make the PIC32 enumerate as a mouse

###HW 8:
[MPLAB Harmony](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-harmony) CDC project; use PUTTY to send an int to the PIC32, and have it return the int

###HW 9:
Write an Anrdoid App (Hello World). 

###HW 10: 
Use CAD to make a wheel hub for your motor and o-ring. 3D print it.

###HW 13:
Write an Android app that communicates with a PIC32 CDC device.  

###HW 14: 
Write an Android app that mixes the camera and CDC apps together. 

###HW 15:
Complete the PIC CDC code that controls your motors based on the information being sent from your phone.

###HW 16:  
Final line following robot code. Final robot design.
